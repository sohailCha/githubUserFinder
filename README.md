# githubUserFinder
The project is able to make API call to github databases to fetch user profiles and latest repositories based on the input provided by the user.

All the files are provided with the project but for the project to work, one have to get client id and client secret key from github oauth. 
Github only allow 100 API request per hour, and thats not very efficient because sooner or later, you will run out of it especially when you are developing the project. Thus for that its recommended to register your project with github by getting client ID and secret key via oAuth apps.

Once, you have the ID and key, you have to put your ID and Key in github.js file and the website should be able to serve you up with user profiles and latest repos of that user.

I have uploaded images along with the files, so that you can have idea about how this project works.

Thank You
